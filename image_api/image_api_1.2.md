## Abstract

This document describes an image delivery API proposed by the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) group. The IIIF image API specifies a web service that returns an image in response to a standard http or https request. The URL can specify the region, size, rotation, quality characteristics and format of the requested image. A URL can also be constructed to request basic technical information about the image to support client applications. The IIIF API was conceived of to facilitate systematic reuse of image resources in digital image repositories maintained by cultural heritage organizations. The API could be adopted by any image repository or service, and can be used to retrieve static images in response to a properly constructed URL.

Please send feedback to [iiif-discuss@googlegroups.com][1]

##  1. Audience

This document is intended for developers building applications that share digital image assets. This includes:

  * Developers building digital image repositories who would like to offer services for easily sharing digital images with other repositories, web applications, or other software that uses images from the web.
  * Developers building web applications or software that want to retrieve images from compliant repositories.
  * A specifically targeted audience are developers and managers of digital image repositories, web applications and image tools at cultural heritage institutions, like museums, libraries and archives.

##  2. URL Syntax

The IIIF Image API can be called in three ways: 
 * Request an image, which may be part of a larger image 
 * Request a description of the available features of the image
 * Request the capabilities supported by the image server

All three convey the request's information in the path segments of the URI, rather than as query parameters. This makes responses easier to cache, either at the server or by standard web-caching infrastructure. It also permits a minimal implementation using pre-computed files in a matching directory structure.

There are four parameters shared by the requests, and other IIIF specifications:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| scheme | Indicates the use of the http or https protocol in calling the service. |
| server | The host server on which the service resides. |
| prefix | The path on the host server to the service. This prefix is optional, but may be useful when the host server supports multiple services. The prefix MAY contain multiple path segments, delimited by slashes, but all other special characters MUST be encoded. See [Section 9 - URL Encoding and Decoding](#9-url-encoding-and-decoding) for more information. |
| identifier | The identifier of the requested image, expressed as a string. This may be an ark, URN, filename, or other identifier. Special characters MUST be URI encoded. |

The combination of these parameters forms the image’s base URI, according to the following URI Template ([RFC6570][26]):

```
{scheme}://{server}{/prefix}/{identifier}
```

To allow for extension, this specification does not define the behaviour of an implementing server when it receives requests that do not match one of described request syntaxes.

###  2.1. Image Request URL Syntax

The IIIF Image API URL for requesting an image MUST conform to the following URI Template:
```
{scheme}://{server}{/prefix}/{identifier}/{region}/{size}/{rotation}/{quality}{.format}
```
For example:
```
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/full/0/native.jpg
```

The sections of the Image Request URL include region, size, rotation, quality and format parameters defining the characteristics of the returned image. These are described in detail in [Section 4 - Image Request Parameters](#4-image-request-parameters).

###  2.2. Image Information Request URL Syntax

The IIIF Image API URL for requesting image information MUST conform to the following URI Template:
```
{scheme}://{server}{/prefix}/{identifier}/info.json
```
For example:
```
http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/info.json
```

For each image made available, the server, prefix and identifier components of the information request must be identical to those for the image request described above.  It is recommended that if the image’s base URI is dereferenced, then the client should either redirect to the information request using a 303 status code (see [Section 6.1 - Successful Responses](#61-successful-responses)), or return the same result. See [Section 5.1 - Image Information Request](#51-image-information-request) for more information.

### 2.3. Capabilities Request URL Syntax

IIIF Image API implementations MAY support requests for a description of capabilities. The IIIF Image API URL for requesting the set of capabilities that the server supports SHOULD conform to the following syntax:
```
{scheme}://{server}{/prefix}/capabilities.json
```
For example:
```
http://www.example.org/image-service/capabilities.json
```

Each image information response (info.json) SHOULD link to the capabilities document if it is available.  Clients SHOULD NOT assume the existence of the capabilities document if it is not linked, and instead use the profile document if present in the image information response.  See [Section 5.2 - Server Capabilities Request](#52-server-capabilities-request) for more information.

##  3. Identifier

The API places no restrictions on the form of the identifiers that a server may use or support, although the identifier MUST be expressed as a string. All special characters (e.g. ? or #) MUST be URI encoded to avoid unpredictable client behaviors. The URL syntax relies upon slash (/) separators so any slashes in the identifier MUST be URI encoded (aka. percent-encoded, replace / with %2F ). See discussion in [Section 9 - URL Encoding and Decoding](#9-url-encoding-and-decoding).

##  4. Image Request Parameters

All parameters described below are required for compliant construction of a IIIF image API URL. The sequence of parameters in the URL MUST be in the order described below. The order of the parameters is also intended as the order of the operations by which the service should manipulate the image content. Thus, the image content is first extracted as a region of the source image, then scaled to the requested size, rotated and transformed into the color depth and format. This resulting image content is returned as the representation for the URL. Image and region dimensions in pixels are always given as an integer numbers. Intermediate calculations may use floating point numbers and the rounding method is implementation specific. Some parameters, notably percentages, may be specified with floating point numbers. These should have at most 10 decimal digits and consist only of decimal digits and “.” with a leading zero if less than 1.

###  4.1. Region

The region parameter defines the rectangular portion of the source image to be returned. Region can be specified by pixel coordinates, percentage or by the value “full”, which specifies that the entire region of the source image should be returned.

| Form |  Description |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| full                     | The complete image is returned, without any cropping. |
| x,y,w,h                  | The region of the source image to be returned is defined in terms of absolute pixel values. The value of x represents the number of pixels from the 0 position on the horizontal axis. The value of y represents the number of pixels from the 0 position on the vertical axis. Thus the x,y position 0,0 is the upper left-most pixel of the image. w represents the width of the region and h represents the height of the region in pixels.  |
| pct:x,y,w,h              | The region to be returned is specified as a sequence of percentages of the source image’s dimensions. Thus, x represents the number of pixels from the 0 position on the horizontal axis, calculated as a percentage of the source image’s width. w represents the width of the region calculated as a percentage of the source image’s width. The same applies to y and h respectively. These may be floating point numbers (see [Section 5 - Image Information Request][14]). |

If the request specifies a region which extends beyond the dimensions of the source image, then the service should return an image cropped at the boundary of the source image.

If the requested region's height or width is zero, or if the region is entirely outside the bounds of the source image, then the server MUST return a 400 (bad request) status code.

Examples:

  1. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/full/0/native.jpg`
  2. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/80,15,60,75/full/0/native.jpg`
  3. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/80,15,125,200/full/0/native.jpg`
  4. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/pct:10,10,80,70/full/0/native.jpg`
  5. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/pct:20,20,100,100/full/0/native.jpg`

###  4.2. Size

The size parameter determines the dimensions to which the extracted region is to be scaled.

| Form | Description |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| full           | The extracted region is not scaled, and is returned at its full size. |
| w,             | The extracted region should be scaled so that its width is exactly equal to w, and the height will be a calculated value that maintains the aspect ratio of the requested region. |
| ,h             | The extracted region should be scaled so that its height is exactly equal to h, and the width will be a calculated value that maintains the aspect ratio of the requested region. |
| pct:n          | The width and height of the returned image is scaled to n% of the width and height of the extracted region. The aspect ratio of the returned image is the same as that of the extracted region. |
| w,h            | The width and height of the returned image are exactly w and h. The aspect ratio of the returned image MAY be different than the extracted region, resulting in a distorted image. |
| !w,h           | The image content is scaled for the best fit such that the resulting width and height are less than or equal to the requested width and height. The exact scaling MAY be determined by the service provider, based on characteristics including image quality and system performance. The dimensions of the returned image content are calculated to maintain the aspect ratio of the extracted region. |

If the resulting height or width is zero, then the server MUST return a 400 (bad request) status code.

The image server MAY support scaling beyond the full size of the extracted region.

Examples:

  1. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/full/0/native.jpg`
  2. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/100,/0/native.jpg`
  3. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/,100/0/native.jpg`
  4. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/pct:50/0/native.jpg`
  5. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/150,75/0/native.jpg`
  6. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/!150,75/0/native.jpg`

###  4.3. Rotation

The rotation value represents the number of degrees of clockwise rotation from the original, and may be any floating point number from 0 to 360. Initially most services will only support 0, 90, 180 or 270 as valid values.

| Form | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| n    | The degrees of clockwise rotation from the original, from 0 up to 360. |

Examples:

  1. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/full/0/native.jpg`
  2. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/full/90/native.jpg`
  3. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/full/180/native.jpg`
  4. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/full/270/native.jpg`
  5. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/full/22.5/native.jpg`

In most cases a rotation will change the width and height dimensions of the returned image file. The service SHOULD return an image file that contains all of the image contents requested in the region and size parameters, even if the dimensions of the returned image file are different than specified in the size parameter. The image contents SHOULD NOT be scaled as a result of the rotation, and there SHOULD be no additional space between the corners of the rotated image contents and the bounding box of the returned image file.

For non-90-degree rotations the API does not specify the background color.

###  4.4. Quality

The quality parameter determines the tonality***(?????)*** of the delivered image. The quality value of "native" requests an image that is of the quality the sever deems the best available. This is likely--but not required--to be the same quality as the source image.

| Quality | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| native  | The image is in the quality the server deems best. |
| color   | The image is returned in color. |
| grey    | The image is returned in greyscale, where each pixel is black, white or any degree of grey in between. |
| bitonal | The image returned is bitonal, where each pixel is either black or white. This specification makes no recommendation regarding the algorithm that should be used to make image bitonal. |

Examples:

  1. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/600,/0/native.jpg`
  2. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/600,/0/color.jpg`
  3. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/600,/0/grey.jpg`
  4. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/600,/0/bitonal.jpg`

###  4.5. Format

The format of the returned image is optionally expressed as an extension at the end of the URL.

| Extension | MIME Type |
| --------- | --------- |
| jpg | image/jpeg |
| tif | image/tiff |
| png | image/png |
| gif | image/gif |
| jp2 | image/jp2 |
| pdf | application/pdf |

  1. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/600,/0/native.jpg`
  2. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/600,/0/native.png`
  3. `http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/600,/0/native.tif`

If the format is not specified in the URI, then the server SHOULD use the HTTP Accept header to determine the client’s preferences for the format. The server may either do 200 (return the representation in the response) or 30x (redirect to the correct URI with a format extension) style content negotiation. If neither are given, then the server should use a default format of its own choosing. 

### 4.6. Order of Implementation

The sequence of parameters in the URL is intended to express the order in which image manipulations are made against the original. This is important to consider when implementing the service because applying the same parameters in a different sequence will often result in a different image being delivered. The order is critical so that the application calling the service reliably receives the output it expects.

The parameters should be interpreted as if the the sequence of image manipulations were:

Region THEN Size THEN Rotation THEN Quality THEN Format

### 4.7. Canonical URI Syntax

There are three situations where the diversity in ways of requesting the same image is a hindrance:
* Static file based implementations will have one file for each possible request, and thus in order to not get an HTTP 404 Not Found response, the client must use the same canonical syntax as the server.
* Caching becomes significantly more efficient, both client and server side, when the URIs used are the same between systems and sessions.
* Response times can be improved by avoiding redirects from the requested URI syntax to the canonical syntax by using the canonical form directly

In order to support the above requirements, clients should construct the image request URIs using to following canonical parameter values where possible.

| Parameter | Canonical value |
| --------- | --------------- |
| region    | "full" if the whole image is requested, otherwise the x,y,w,h description of the region. |
| size      | "full" if the native size is requested, otherwise the pixel dimensions w,h. |
| rotation  | An integer if possible, and trimming any trailing zeros in a decimal value. |
| quality   | "native" unless a quality that is different from the native quality is requested. |
| format    | Explicit format string required |

When the client requests an image, the server MAY add a link header that indicates the canonical URI for that request:

```
Link: <http://iiif.example.com/server/full/full/0/native.jpg>;rel="canonical"
```

##  5. Information Requests

There are two types of information requests: one to get information about an image (Image Information Request) and one to get information about the capabilities of the server (Server Capabilities Request).

The syntax for the responses to both types of request is [JSON-LD][37]. The content-type of the response MUST be either "application/json" (regular JSON), or "application/ld+json" (JSON-LD).  If the client explicitly wants the JSON-LD content-type, then it must specify this in an Accept header, otherwise the server must return the regular JSON content-type.

If the regular JSON content-type is returned, then it is RECOMMENDED that the server provide a link header to the context document. The syntax for the link header is below, and further [described in section 6.8 of the JSON-LD specification][38]. If the client requests "application/ld+json", the link header MAY still be included but MUST be ignored. The entity body is identical regardless of the content-type, including the @context field.

```
Link: <http://iiif.io/api/image/1.2/context.json>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"
```

Servers SHOULD send the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header with the value \* in response to information requests. The syntax is shown below and is described int the [CORS][41] specification. This header is required in order to allow the JSON responses to be used by Web applications hosted on different servers.
 
 ```
 Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
 ```

### 5.1. Image Information Request

The service MUST return technical information about the requested image. The request for technical information MUST conform to the URI Template:

```
{scheme}://{server}{/prefix}/{identifier}/info.json
```


The response will return the following information

| Property | Required? | Description |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| @context | Required | The context document that describes the semantics of the terms used in the document. This must be the URI: [http://iiif.io/api/image/1.2/context.json] for version 1.2 of the IIIF Image API. This document allows the response to be interpreted as RDF, using the [JSON-LD][29] serialization. |
| @id | Required | The base URI of the image (as defined in [Section 2 - URL Syntax](#2-url-syntax)), including scheme, server, prefix and identifier without a trailing slash. |
| width | Required | The width of the source image. |
| height | Required | The height of the source image. | 
| protocol | Required | The URI "http://iiif.io/api/image" which can be used to determine that the document describes an image service which is a version of the IIIF Image API. |
| scale_factors | Optional | Some image servers support the creation of multiple resolution levels for a single image in order to optimize the efficiency in delivering images of different sizes. The scale_factors element expresses a list of resolution scaling factors. For example a scale factor of 4 indicates that the service can efficiently deliver images at 25% of the height and width of the source image. |
| sizes | Optional | An array of dimensions in the "w,h," syntax that the server has available. This may be used to let the client know other sizes that are available when the server does not support requests for arbirary sizes, or simply as a hint that requesting an image of this size may result in a faster response. |
| tile_width | Optional | Some image servers efficiently support delivery of predefined tiles enabling easy assembly of portions of the image. It is assumed that the same tile sizes are used for all scale factors supported. The tile_width element expresses the width of the predefined tiles. |
| tile_height | Optional | The tile_height element expresses the height of the predefined tiles. See description of tile_width. |
| formats | Optional | The list of image format parameter values available for the image. |
| qualities | Optional | The list of image quality parameter values available for the image. |
| profile | Optional | URI indicating the compliance level supported. Values as described in [Section 8 - Compliance Levels](#8-compliance-levels) |
| capabilities | Optional | URI for a capabilities document the describes the capabilities supported. See [Section 5.2 - Server Capabilities Request](#52-server-capabilities-request) for more information about this document |


The JSON response should conform to the format shown in the following example:

```javascript
{ 
  "@context" : "http://iiif.io/api/image/1.2/context.json", 
  "@id" : "http://iiif.example.com/prefix/1E34750D-38DB-4825-A38A-B60A345E591C", 
  "protocol" : "http://iiif.io/api/image",
  "width" : 6000, 
  "height" : 4000, 
  "scale_factors" : [ 1, 2, 4 ], 
  "sizes" : [ "150,100", "360,240", "3600,2400" ], 
  "tile_width" : 1024, 
  "tile_height" : 1024, 
  "formats" : [ "jpg", "png" ], 
  "qualities" : [ "native", "grey" ], 
  "profile" : "http://iiif.io/api/image/1.2/profiles/level1.json",
  "capabilities" : "http://iiif.example.com/prefix/capabilities.json"
}
```

Additional properties not specified here may be included but should be ignored if not understood.

### 5.2. Server Capabilities Request

A server MAY declare the set of capabilities that it implements in a capabilities document, which is linked to from the JSON response described in Section 5.1, in greater detail than is possible using the enumerated compliance levels in the profile property.

| Property | Required? | Description |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| @context | Required | The context document that describes the semantics of the terms used in the document. This must be the URI: [http://iiif.io/api/image/1.2/context.json] for version 1.2 of the IIIF Image API. This document allows the response to be interpreted as RDF, using the [JSON-LD][29] serialization |
| @id      | Required | The URI of this capabilities document |
| contact  | Optional | A mailto URI for a person to contact about this service | 
| content_negotiation | Optional | Does the service support content negotation for image format? (boolean) |
| default_format | Optional | The default format that the service will use when the image format is not supplied by the client (string) |
| region_by_pct | Optional | Does the service support requesting regions of images given by percentage (boolean) |
| region_by_px | Optional | Does the service support requesting regions of images given by pixel dimensions (boolean) |

```

##  6. Server Responses

###  6.1. Successful Responses

Servers may transmit HTTP responses with 200 (Successful) or 3xx (Redirect) status codes when the request has been successfully processed. If the status code is 200, then the entity-body MUST be the requested image or information response. If the status code is 301, 302, 303, or 304, then the entity-body is unrestricted, but it is RECOMMENDED to be empty. If the status code is 301, 302, or 303 then the Location HTTP Header MUST be set containing the URL of the image that fulfills the request. This enables servers to have a single canonical URL to promote caching of responses. Status code 304 is handled exactly as per the HTTP specification. Clients should therefore expect to encounter all of these situations and not assume that the entity-body of the initial response necessarily contains the image data.

###  6.2. Error Conditions

The order in which servers parse requests and detect errors is not specified. A request will fail on the first error encountered and return an appropriate http status code, with common codes given in the list below. It is recommended that the body of the error response includes a human-readable description of the error in either plain text or html.

| Error Code | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 400 Bad Request | This response is used when it is impossible for the server to fulfil the request, for example if the combination of parameters would result in a zero-sized image. |
| 401 Unauthorized | Authentication is required and not provided. See Section 7 below for details. |
| 403 Forbidden | The user, authenticated or not, is not permitted to perform the requested operation. |
| 404 Not Found | The image resource specified by [identifier] does not exist|
| 406 Not Acceptable| The server does not support the format requested by Content Negotiation. If the requested format is specified in the URI, and the server is not able to deliver it, then the appropriate error code is 400. |
| 500 Internal Server Error | The server encountered an unexpected error that prevented it from fulfilling the request. |
| 501 Not Implemented | A valid IIIF request that is not implemented by this server. If the requested format is not implemented then a 415 error should be used. |
| 503 Service Unavailable | Used when the server is busy/temporarily unavailable due to load/maintenance issues. An alternative to connection refusal with the option to specify a back-off period. |

##  7. Authentication

This API does not specify whether the image server will support authentication or what mechanism it might use. In the case of "401 Unauthorized" HTTP error response, the content of the WWW-Authenticate header will depend on the authentication mechanism supported by the server. If the server supports HTTP Basic or Digest authentication then the header should follow [RFC2617][30], for example:

```
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Images"
```

##  8. Compliance Levels

A service should specify on all responses the extent to which the API is supported. This is done by including an HTTP Link header ([RFC5988][31]) entry pointing to the description of the highest level of conformance of which ALL of the requirements are met. The “rel” type to be used is “profile”, and thus a complete header might look like:

```
Link: <http://iiif.io/api/image/1.2/profiles/level1.json>;rel="profile"
```

An image server MAY declare different compliance levels for different images. If the compliance level is not indicated, then a client should assume level 0 compliance only. For detailed compliance definitions see XXX.

The compliance profile URI given in the Link header (between &lt; and &gt;) may also be returned in the profile property of responses to Image Information Requests.

##  9. URL Encoding and Decoding

The URL syntax of this API relies upon slash (/) separators which MUST NOT be encoded. Clients MUST percent-encode special characters (the to-encode set below: percent and gen-delims of [RFC3986][32] except the colon) within the components of requests. For example, any slashes within the identifier part of the URL MUST be percent-encoded. Encoding is necessary only for the identifier because other components will not include special characters.

```
to-encode = "/" / "?" / "#" / "[" / "]" / "@" / "%"
```

Upon receiving an API request, a server MUST first split the URL path on slashes and then decode any percent-encoded characters in each component.

Additionally, if identifiers include any characters outside the US-ASCII set then the encoding to octets must be defined consistently on client and server, and the octets MUST be percent-encoded. Percent-encoding other characters introduces no ambiguity but is unnecessary.

| Parameters | URL path |
| ---------- | -------- |
| identifier=id1 region=full size=full rotation=0 quality=native | id1/full/full/0/native |
| identifier=id1 region=0,10,100,200 size=pct:50 rotation=90 quality=native format=png | id1/0,10,100,200/pct:50/90/native.png |

| identifier=ark:/12025/654xz321 region=full size=full rotation=0 quality=native | ark:%2F12025%2F654xz321/full/full/0/native |
| identifier=urn:foo:a123,456 region=full size=full rotation=0 quality=native | urn:foo:a123,456/full/full/0/native |
| identifier=urn:sici:1046-8188(199501)13:1%3C69:FTTHBI%3E2.0.TX;2-4 region=full size=full rotation=0 quality=native | urn:sici:1046-8188(199501)13:1%253C69:FTTHBI%253E2.0.TX;2-4/full/full/0/native |
| identifier=http://example.com/?54#a region=full size=full rotation=0 quality=native | http:%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%3F54%23a/full/full/0/native |

Servers which are incapable of processing arbitrarily encoded identifiers SHOULD make their best efforts to expose only image identifiers for which typical clients will not encode any of the characters, and thus it is RECOMMENDED to limit characters in identifiers to letters, numbers and the underscore character.

##  10. Security Considerations

This API defines a URI syntax and the semantics associated with its components. The composition of URIs has few security considerations except possible exposure of sensitive information in URIs or revealing of browse/view behavior of users.

Server applications implementing this API must consider possible denial-of-service attacks, and authentication vulnerabilities based on DNS spoofing. Applications must be careful to parse incoming requests (URIs) in ways that avoid overflow or injection attacks.

Early sanity checking of URI’s (lengths, trailing GET, invalid characters, out-of-range parameters) and rejection with appropriate response codes is recommended.

##  A. Implementation Notes

  * For use cases that enable the saving of the image, it is RECOMMENDED to use the HTTP Content-Disposition header ([RFC6266][33]) to provide a convenient filename that distinguishes the image, based on the identifier and parameters provided.
  * This specification makes no assertion about the rights status of requested images or metadata, whether or not authentication has been accomplished. Please see the IIIF Metadata API for rights information.
  * This API does not specify how image servers fulfill requests, what quality the returned images will have for different parameters, or how parameters may affect performance. See the compliance document for more discussion.
  * Image identifiers that include the slash (/ %2F) or backslash (\ %5C) characters may cause problems with some HTTP servers. Apache servers from version 2.2.18 support the "AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode" (link to ) configuration directive which will correctly pass these characters to client applications without rejecting or decoding them. Servers using older versions of Apache and local identifiers which include these characters will need to use a workaround such as internally translating or escaping slash and backslash to safe value (perhaps by double URL-encoding them).
  * As described in [Section 4.3 - Rotation](#43-rotation), in order to retain the size of the requested image contents, rotation will change the width and height dimensions of the returned image file. A formula for calculating the dimensions of the returned image file for a given rotation can be found here.
